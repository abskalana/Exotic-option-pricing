This document explains a Monte Carlo-based option pricing model, focusing on both standard and exotic options like Asian and lookback options. The simulation models the underlying asset's price using geometric Brownian motion and calculates option payoffs based on the option type (call/put). Exotic options are handled by adjusting the payoff calculations, such as using the average asset price for Asian options or the maximum price for lookback options. The simulated payoffs are discounted using the risk-free rate, and the final option price is the average of these discounted payoffs. The code implements this logic by generating multiple paths, calculating payoffs, and averaging them for a price estimate.
